Tested with following:   
| Wine version | Works |   
| ------------- | ------------- |   
| Wine-staging 10.13 | ❌ |   
| Wine-staging 11.1 | ✅ |   
   
* 10.13 Davinci Resolve doesn't recognise the gpu "Unsupported GPU Processing Mode"   
* 11.1 Launches, but video playback doesn't work and is a lil janky overall
